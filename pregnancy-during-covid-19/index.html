				<hr><p>Being pregnant is supposed to be an exciting time for new expecting parents but the excitement was overcome with stress, worry, and fear. Once Covid 19 happened everything about my pregnancy had changed. We were told we couldn't see loved ones let alone leave the house. I had to leave work earlier than expected and soon my husband and I became prisoners in our own home. Luckily we happened to be home bodies so being told to stay home wasn't hard for us to do. What made it hard for me was that I couldn't go grocery shopping, shop for baby clothes etc. Doing the grocery shopping every week was my time away, it is something I enjoy doing. </p><p>	I soon had to come to the realization that staying home was the safest thing for my and my baby. The hardest part was when all appointments for the baby had to be done without my husband present. At the start of my pregnancy my husband came to every ultrasound and appointment. When they made it impossible for anyone to come to any and all doctor appointments all the excitement we had was suddenly paused. Due to my pregnancy being High Risk we got ultrasounds done weekly so I always had pictures to bring home to my husband. We just held on to those pictures and that our little one was safe and we would be seeing and holding him soon.</p><p>The months went by and the time had finally come for our Baby Shower. Every mother to be looks forward to the Baby Shower and I was planning my shower before my pregnancy was even confirmed. I knew exactly what I wanted and how I expected everything to be. My mother, sister, and Mimi had planned my shower but it ended up being canceled do to Covid 19 social distancing restrictions. I think I was mostly upset because I knew how much work they had put into and all the little details. We didn't want to just cancel the shower all together so that's when we came up with a plan. My husband and I decided on doing a Virtual shower and video chatted with all our family and friends while opening all the gifts that were sent to us. It might not have been what we planned for but it ended up working out great.</p><p>	Fast forward almost 2 months, and it was finally time for our son. I am so thankful that my husband was able to join me in the delivery room and stay by my side through it all. I was so scared of the possibility of having to go through it alone. At the time, some hospitals in other states were not allowing anyone else in  Labor and Delivery. I really feel for those women and families that had to deal with that. Delivery is hard enough on a women, having to go through it alone is just unimaginable. I thank god every day we were able to go through it together. </p><p>Today, we are blessed with an amazing little boy who is thriving and growing so fast each and every day. If it wasn't for my husband I don't think I would have been able to get through the pregnancy and delivery as well as I did. Family and positivity is key in getting through any hurtle in life, Covid 19 is just another hurtle. </p><p></p><p></p>
