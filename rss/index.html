Once Covid 19 happened everything about my pregnancy had changed. We were told we couldn't see loved ones let alone leave the house. I had to leave work earlier than expected and soon my husband and I became prisoners in our own home. Luckily we happened to be home bodies so being told to stay home wasn't hard for us to do. What made it hard for me was that I couldn't go grocery shopping, shop for baby clothes etc. Doing the grocery shopping every week was my time away, it is something I enjoy doing. </p><p>	I soon had to come to the realization that staying home was the safest thing for my and my baby. The hardest part was when all appointments for the baby had to be done without my husband present. At the start of my pregnancy my husband came to every ultrasound and appointment. When they made it impossible for anyone to come to any and all doctor appointments all the excitement we had was suddenly paused. Due to my pregnancy being High Risk we got ultrasounds done weekly so I always had pictures to bring home to my husband. We just held on to those pictures and that our little one was safe and we would be seeing and holding him soon.</p><p>The months went by and the time had finally come for our Baby Shower. Every mother to be looks forward to the Baby Shower and I was planning my shower before my pregnancy was even confirmed. I knew exactly what I wanted and how I expected everything to be. My mother, sister, and Mimi had planned my shower but it ended up being canceled do to Covid 19 social distancing restrictions. I think I was mostly upset because I knew how much work they had put into and all the little details. We didn't want to just cancel the shower all together so that's when we came up with a plan. My husband and I decided on doing a Virtual shower and video chatted with all our family and friends while opening all the gifts that were sent to us. It might not have been what we planned for but it ended up working out great.</p><p>	Fast forward almost 2 months, and it was finally time for our son. I am so thankful that my husband was able to join me in the delivery room and stay by my side through it all. I was so scared of the possibility of having to go through it alone. At the time, some hospitals in other states were not allowing anyone else in Â Labor and Delivery. I really feel for those women and families that had to deal with that. Delivery is hard enough on a women, having to go through it alone is just unimaginable. I thank god every day we were able to go through it together. </p><p>Today, we are blessed with an amazing little boy who is thriving and growing so fast each and every day. If it wasn't for my husband I don't think I would have been able to get through the pregnancy and delivery as well as I did. Family and positivity is key in getting through any hurtle in life, Covid 19 is just another hurtle. </p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Momma Must Have's]]></title><description><![CDATA[<hr><h2 id="-la-vie-lactation-massager-roller-stimulate-milk-flow">* La Vie: Lactation Massager Roller; Stimulate Milk Flow</h2><p>I would rate this product a 10 out of 10!

It works great, makes massaging my breasts before pumping or breastfeeding so much easier. </p><hr><h2 id="-la-vie-warming-lactation-massage-pads-improve-milk-flow-save-time-heat-vibration-">* La Vie: Warming Lactation Massage Pads; Improve Milk Flow &amp; Save Time, Heat &amp; Vibration.</h2><p>I would rate this product a definite 10 out of 10! I instantly start to lactate the moment I turn them on prior to starting my breast pump. I also greatly enjoy the warming feature, it helps sooth my sore breasts and nipples especially after my son cluster feeds. The vibration setting is also a plus because it really gets that milk flowing.</p><hr><h2 id="-la-vie-pump-strap-hands-free">* La Vie: Pump Strap Hands Free</h2><p>I would rate this product a 10 out of 10! Being able to multitask while pumping and or nursing is the best. I have tried several " nursing bras" and I have come to find that this one is the only one that really works. I don't have to worry about holding the bottles in position while I'm pumping because this bra compresses for me. It is also quite comfortable being that it doubles as a halter and strapless and velcro's in the back. </p><hr><h2 id="resources-">Resources: </h2><p><a href="https://www.laviemom.com/collections/all">https://www.laviemom.com/collections/all</a>	</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Boosting your Booby Juice Supply!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<hr><p>Being a first time mom is hard enough, but not having control over the amount of milk you produce can be stressful.

These are a few products I have tried and have come to find have been a big help in boosting my Booby Juice supply. </p><hr><h2 id="body-armor">Body Armor </h2><p>10 out of 10 for a yummy way to boost your Booby Juice Supply! Highly recommend getting the 28 oz bottles for only a $1.00 at Festival. I go through these so fast. They have a variety of flavors, Peach Mango is my personal fav! </p><p>They can be found on Amazon, at your local Pick N Save, Piggly Wiggly, Festival.</p><hr><h2 id="pink-stork-lactation-tea">Pink Stork Lactation Tea</h2><p>This product works great and for that I would rate it a 9 out of 10. If the taste was better I would say a 10 out of 10. I think it needs to be drunk before every pumping to really see good results. I have come to find that if I don't have it for every pump my milk supply isn't as good. You can drink this hot or cold, I highly recommend adding a slice or 2 of lemon. It only comes in 1 flavor Vanilla Chai, the taste is somewhat overpowering and has a strong black licorice undertone. Adding lemon really tones done the overpowering flavors. </p><p>This product was purchased on Amazon.</p><hr><h2 id="upspring-milk-flow-berry-flavored-breastfeeding-supplement-drink">UpSpring Milk Flow Berry Flavored Breastfeeding Supplement Drink</h2><p>I would rate this drink an 8 out of 10. The taste is not the greatest like my Body Armor but I love that I can add it to shakes and it comes in simple to go packs. This comes in a variety of flavors and can go in smoothies and water. </p><p>This product was purchased on Amazon.</p><hr><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No Bake Lactation Bites]]></title><description><![CDATA[no-bake lactation cookies to boost milk supply]]></description><link>https://neighborlynook.com/lactation-cookies/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f205e4fab78810001ef3367</guid><category><![CDATA[recipe]]></category><category><![CDATA[breastfeeding]]></category><category><![CDATA[baby]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Samantha Zygowicz]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 17:51:20 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a first time mom I have found that these deliciously simple No Bake Bites are a life safer for your Milk Supply. </p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/2020/07/IMG_3727.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/IMG_3727.png 600w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/IMG_3727.png 1000w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/IMG_3727.png 1600w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/IMG_3727.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Ingredients for No Bake Bites</figcaption></figure><h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2><ul><li>2 cups of old-fashioned oats</li><li>1/2 cup of flaxseed meal</li><li>3 tablespoons Brewer's yeast</li><li> 1 cup peanut butter</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li><li>1/2 cup honey</li><li> 1 teaspoon of vanilla</li><li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li></ul><p></p><h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2><p>Mix all ingredients except the chocolate chips together using a electric hand mixer until well combined. </p><p>Stir in the chocolate chips. </p><p>Roll mixture into 2-tablespoon sized balls and place on parchment-lined baking sheet. </p><p>Place in Refrigerator for 30 minutes or eat up right away.
