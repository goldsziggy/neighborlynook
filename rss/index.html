So in order to make it work, I did as all good engineers do, and followed in the footsteps of someone else (see ghost-configuration-guide from the resources). I feel as though I'd be doing a disservice by attempting to regurgitate an already good guide for the installation steps of the pieces.  The only part not captured by the guide is setting up my ghost-to-github-pages docker image.  </p><p><strong>Ghost to GitHub pages:</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code>docker build --build-arg GH_PAT=abc123 --build-arg GH_REPO=github.com/goldsziggy/neighborlynook.git --build-arg GHOST_SERVER_URL="https://hidden.example.com" --build-arg GIT_EMAIL="matt@zygowicz.com" --build-arg GIT_NAME="Matthew Zygwoicz" -t ghost-on-git .</code></pre><figcaption>docker build command</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code>docker run -it ghost-on-git</code></pre><figcaption>docker run commands</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-it-works-">How it works.</h2><p>This section will more-or-less be going over the following network diagram.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/2020/07/Neighborly-Nook-Setup-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="How this blog was made" srcset="https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Neighborly-Nook-Setup-1.png 600w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Neighborly-Nook-Setup-1.png 1000w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Neighborly-Nook-Setup-1.png 1600w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/2020/07/Neighborly-Nook-Setup-1.png 1768w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Diagram showing the interaction flow</figcaption></figure><p>both the diagram and our blogging adventures start with the family navigating to the ghost application in the browser via an internal URL.  behind the scenes the request is sent to our local server and filtered through the Nginx config.  the Nginx config, which works as a reverse proxy, intercepts the subdomain and forwards the request to ghost running on that server.  Once the request has made it to Ghost, then Ghost can simply behave as normal and serve up its user experience and allow us to write our blog pages.</p><p>Noticed from the diagram viewer traffic never actually touches our infrastructure and instead all get filtered through Github.  That is because this blog is 100% hosted as static pages from Github (check out the repo from the resources below! make this a hyperlink...).  The dockerized cronjob is the magic glue to make this happen.</p><p>The dockerized job is a simple script.

Once Covid 19 happened everything about my pregnancy had changed. We were told we couldn't see loved ones let alone leave the house. I had to leave work earlier than expected and soon my husband and I became prisoners in our own home. Luckily we happened to be home bodies so being told to stay home wasn't hard for us to do. What made it hard for me was that I couldn't go grocery shopping, shop for baby clothes etc. Doing the grocery shopping every week was my time away, it is something I enjoy doing. </p><p>	I soon had to come to the realization that staying home was the safest thing for my and my baby. The hardest part was when all appointments for the baby had to be done without my husband present. At the start of my pregnancy my husband came to every ultrasound and appointment. When they made it impossible for anyone to come to any and all doctor appointments all the excitement we had was suddenly paused. Due to my pregnancy being High Risk we got ultrasounds done weekly so I always had pictures to bring home to my husband. We just held on to those pictures and that our little one was safe and we would be seeing and holding him soon.</p><p>The months went by and the time had finally come for our Baby Shower. Every mother to be looks forward to the Baby Shower and I was planning my shower before my pregnancy was even confirmed. I knew exactly what I wanted and how I expected everything to be. My mother, sister, and Mimi had planned my shower but it ended up being canceled do to Covid 19 social distancing restrictions. I think I was mostly upset because I knew how much work they had put into and all the little details. We didn't want to just cancel the shower all together so that's when we came up with a plan. My husband and I decided on doing a Virtual shower and video chatted with all our family and friends while opening all the gifts that were sent to us. It might not have been what we planned for but it ended up working out great.</p><p>	Fast forward almost 2 months, and it was finally time for our son. I am so thankful that my husband was able to join me in the delivery room and stay by my side through it all. I was so scared of the possibility of having to go through it alone. At the time, some hospitals in other states were not allowing anyone else in  Labor and Delivery. I really feel for those women and families that had to deal with that. Delivery is hard enough on a women, having to go through it alone is just unimaginable. I thank god every day we were able to go through it together. </p><p>Today, we are blessed with an amazing little boy who is thriving and growing so fast each and every day. If it wasn't for my husband I don't think I would have been able to get through the pregnancy and delivery as well as I did. Family and positivity is key in getting through any hurtle in life, Covid 19 is just another hurtle. </p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Momma Must Have's]]></title><description><![CDATA[<hr><h2 id="-la-vie-lactation-massager-roller-stimulate-milk-flow">* La Vie: Lactation Massager Roller; Stimulate Milk Flow</h2><p>I would rate this product a 10 out of 10!

I instantly start to lactate the moment I turn them on prior to starting my breast pump. I also greatly enjoy the warming feature, it helps sooth my sore breasts and nipples especially after my son cluster feeds. The vibration setting is also a plus because it really gets that milk flowing.</p><hr><h2 id="-la-vie-pump-strap-hands-free">* La Vie: Pump Strap Hands Free</h2><p>I would rate this product a 10 out of 10! Being able to multitask while pumping and or nursing is the best. I have tried several " nursing bras" and I have come to find that this one is the only one that really works. I don't have to worry about holding the bottles in position while I'm pumping because this bra compresses for me. It is also quite comfortable being that it doubles as a halter and strapless and velcro's in the back. </p><hr><h2 id="resources-">Resources: </h2><p><a href="https://www.laviemom.com/collections/all">https://www.laviemom.com/collections/all</a>	</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Boosting your Booby Juice Supply!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<hr><p>Being a first time mom is hard enough, but not having control over the amount of milk you produce can be stressful.

Highly recommend getting the 28 oz bottles for only a $1.00 at Festival. I go through these so fast. They have a variety of flavors, Peach Mango is my personal fav! </p><p>They can be found on Amazon, at your local Pick N Save, Piggly Wiggly, Festival.</p><hr><h2 id="pink-stork-lactation-tea">Pink Stork Lactation Tea</h2><p>This product works great and for that I would rate it a 9 out of 10. If the taste was better I would say a 10 out of 10. I think it needs to be drunk before every pumping to really see good results. I have come to find that if I don't have it for every pump my milk supply isn't as good. You can drink this hot or cold, I highly recommend adding a slice or 2 of lemon. It only comes in 1 flavor Vanilla Chai, the taste is somewhat overpowering and has a strong black licorice undertone. Adding lemon really tones done the overpowering flavors. </p><p>This product was purchased on Amazon.</p><hr><h2 id="upspring-milk-flow-berry-flavored-breastfeeding-supplement-drink">UpSpring Milk Flow Berry Flavored Breastfeeding Supplement Drink</h2><p>I would rate this drink an 8 out of 10. The taste is not the greatest like my Body Armor but I love that I can add it to shakes and it comes in simple to go packs. This comes in a variety of flavors and can go in smoothies and water. </p><p>This product was purchased on Amazon.</p><hr><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No Bake Lactation Bites]]></title><description><![CDATA[no-bake lactation cookies to boost milk supply]]></description><link>https://neighborlynook.com/lactation-cookies/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f205e4fab78810001ef3367</guid><category><![CDATA[recipe]]></category><category><![CDATA[breastfeeding]]></category><category><![CDATA[baby]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Samantha Zygowicz]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 17:51:20 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a first time mom I have found that these deliciously simple No Bake Bites are a life safer for your Milk Supply. </p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/2020/07/IMG_3727.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/IMG_3727.png 600w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/IMG_3727.png 1000w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/IMG_3727.png 1600w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/IMG_3727.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Ingredients for No Bake Bites</figcaption></figure><h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2><ul><li>2 cups of old-fashioned oats</li><li>1/2 cup of flaxseed meal</li><li>3 tablespoons Brewer's yeast</li><li> 1 cup peanut butter</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li><li>1/2 cup honey</li><li> 1 teaspoon of vanilla</li><li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li></ul><p></p><h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2><p>Mix all ingredients except the chocolate chips together using a electric hand mixer until well combined. </p><p>Stir in the chocolate chips. </p><p>Roll mixture into 2-tablespoon sized balls and place on parchment-lined baking sheet. </p><p>Place in Refrigerator for 30 minutes or eat up right away.
