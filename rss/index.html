Throughout my pregnancy the doctors made it seem like breastfeeding was so easy and natural, they didn't really prepare me for the ups and downs. When my son was born I thought he was latching on correctly and was getting enough milk, turns out I was wrong. He ended up needing to be bottle fed formula for the first week due to dehydration and being in the NICU for an elevated bilirubin. The doctors kept encouraging me to continue to pump because my breastmilk was the best thing for him. It's filled with nutrition that he can't get from formula. Luckily, once I had enough milk I was able to bottle feed him.</p><p>Breastmilk has so many healthy benefits for babies and it's easier to digest rather than formula. It is also packed with nutrients that changes as your baby grows to insure your baby has everything there body needs. Babies that are breastfed or given breastmilk are less likely to become victims of SIDS. Breastmilk also benefits brain development. Children that were breastfed for the first 6 months of age or more are shown to have higher test scores than children who were given formula for the first 6 months of age. It is also said that babies have an easier time getting back to sleep after a feeding due to the oxytocin and other hormones. </p><p>Our son does a million times better now that he is on breastmilk full time. He had a very difficult time digesting the formula. </p><p></p><h2 id="formula-fed">Formula Fed</h2><hr><p>Some babies have difficulty tolerating it which can cause the babies to have diarrhea and gas. Formula also does not contain Immunoglobulins, no passive immunities for the baby. There are some brands of formula that are similar to breastmilk like Enfamil Enspire NeuroPro. We decided to buy that formula for our son just incase I couldn't produce enough milk. We chose this brand of formula because it is easier for babies to digest and offers the nutrients and vitamins needed for brain development. </p><p>The 2 brands we have tried are Enfamil Gentlelease and Enfamil NeuroPro Infant. Our son didn't like Gentlelease once he was given my breastmilk on a regular basis. He would spit up move frequently or refuse the bottle. That's when we discovered Enfamil NeuroPro Infant. He seems to like the taste and he is able to digest it better. </p><p>Formula may not have all of the benefits as breastmilk but you can find a brand that not only works well for you and your baby but that also has its own benefits. </p><p></p><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://www.medela.com/breastfeeding/mums-journey/breastfeeding-benefits-baby"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">What are the benefits of breastfeeding for your baby?</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">Breast milk is the ideal food for babies.

ease-of-use, extensibility, and ability to self-host or deploy to a static site.  With that in mind, I looked into the below applications.</p><p><strong>WordPress: </strong>I used to do work/blog on a WordPress platform, and while I found the ease-of-use to be there, I never quite liked the UX (and plugin system overload).  So I ruled this one out.</p><p><strong>Gatsby + GitHub pages: </strong>As I started down the path of scaffolding a blogging application out, and started writing the first post, I saw the folder-structure and markdown articles and said "ok, maybe I have to teach the wife a few things".  Then I got to the deployment and thought "Junior engineers struggle with Git, teaching my wife to regurgitate commands shouldn't be an option.  Maybe a script, or do I scrap the idea?"</p><p><strong>Ghost:</strong> I first heard about Ghost about a year ago, it being open-source is a plus.  But hosting costs money, and after digging around on the net I found a GitHub project for ghost-on-GitHub as a static site, which checks my speed of hosting box!  So I started down this path...</p><h2 id="installation">Installation</h2><p>Installation on my home infrastructure was a cinch as most pieces are dockerized. So  to make it work, I did as all good engineers do, and followed in the footsteps of someone else (see ghost-configuration-guide from the resources). I feel as though I'd be doing a disservice by attempting to regurgitate an already good guide for the installation steps of the pieces.  The only part not captured by the guide is setting up my ghost-to-github-pages docker image.  </p><p><strong>Ghost to GitHub pages:</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code class="language-bash">docker build --build-arg GH_PAT=abc123 --build-arg GH_REPO=github.com/goldsziggy/neighborlynook.git --build-arg GHOST_SERVER_URL="https://hidden.example.com" --build-arg GIT_EMAIL="matt@zygowicz.com" --build-arg GIT_NAME="Matthew Zygwoicz" -t ghost-on-git .</code></pre><figcaption>docker build command</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-code-card"><pre><code>docker run -it ghost-on-git</code></pre><figcaption>docker run commands</figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-it-works-">How it works.</h2><p>This section will more-or-less be going over the following network diagram.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/2020/07/Neighborly-Nook-Setup-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="How this blog was made" srcset="https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/Neighborly-Nook-Setup-1.png 600w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/Neighborly-Nook-Setup-1.png 1000w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/Neighborly-Nook-Setup-1.png 1600w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/2020/07/Neighborly-Nook-Setup-1.png 1768w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Diagram showing the interaction flow</figcaption></figure><p>Both the diagram and our blogging adventures start with the family navigating to the Ghost application in the browser via an internal URL.  Behind the scenes, the request is sent to our local server and filtered through the Nginx config.  The Nginx config, which works as a reverse proxy, intercepts the subdomain and forwards the request to ghost running on that server.  From there Ghost can simply behave as normal and serve up its user experience and allow us to write our blog pages.</p><p>The bottom half of the diagram shows user/viewer traffic.  Notice that the line never actually touches our infrastructure and instead all get filtered through Github.  That is because this blog is 100% hosted as static pages from Github (check out the repo from the resources below!).  The dockerized cronjob is the magic glue to make this happen.</p><p>The dockerized job is a simple script. The script takes the following actions:</p><ol><li>Sets up a local git user profile</li><li>Clones the GitHub repo where the static site will be hosted using a Personal Access Token</li><li>Removes all non-git-related files, and adds the CNAME file for GitHub  (this is to have clean commits).</li><li>Use the <code>ghost-static-site-generator</code> npm module to generate the static site. </li><li>Push up the new changeset</li></ol><p>The containerization and scheduling of those 5 steps allow the automation of a static-site generator and easy-to-use blog.  Below you will see the snippet from the dockerized script, or feel free to visit the Github mentioned in the resources below. </p><p>In my home infrastructure I am running my update cron job every hour (which admittedly boosts my Github contribution chart, so I may make a dummy account for this eventually).</p><h3 id="the-script">The Script<br></h3><pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/sh

Once Covid 19 happened everything about my pregnancy had changed. We were told we couldn't see loved ones let alone leave the house. I had to leave work earlier than expected and soon my husband and I became prisoners in our own home. Luckily we happened to be home bodies so being told to stay home wasn't hard for us to do. What made it hard for me was that I couldn't go grocery shopping, shop for baby clothes etc. Doing the grocery shopping every week was my time away, it is something I enjoy doing. </p><p>	I soon had to come to the realization that staying home was the safest thing for my and my baby. The hardest part was when all appointments for the baby had to be done without my husband present. At the start of my pregnancy my husband came to every ultrasound and appointment. When they made it impossible for anyone to come to any and all doctor appointments all the excitement we had was suddenly paused. Due to my pregnancy being High Risk we got ultrasounds done weekly so I always had pictures to bring home to my husband. We just held on to those pictures and that our little one was safe and we would be seeing and holding him soon.</p><p>The months went by and the time had finally come for our Baby Shower. Every mother to be looks forward to the Baby Shower and I was planning my shower before my pregnancy was even confirmed. I knew exactly what I wanted and how I expected everything to be. My mother, sister, and Mimi had planned my shower but it ended up being canceled do to Covid 19 social distancing restrictions. I think I was mostly upset because I knew how much work they had put into and all the little details. We didn't want to just cancel the shower all together so that's when we came up with a plan. My husband and I decided on doing a Virtual shower and video chatted with all our family and friends while opening all the gifts that were sent to us. It might not have been what we planned for but it ended up working out great.</p><p>	Fast forward almost 2 months, and it was finally time for our son. I am so thankful that my husband was able to join me in the delivery room and stay by my side through it all. I was so scared of the possibility of having to go through it alone. At the time, some hospitals in other states were not allowing anyone else in  Labor and Delivery. I really feel for those women and families that had to deal with that. Delivery is hard enough on a women, having to go through it alone is just unimaginable. I thank god every day we were able to go through it together. </p><p>Today, we are blessed with an amazing little boy who is thriving and growing so fast each and every day. If it wasn't for my husband I don't think I would have been able to get through the pregnancy and delivery as well as I did. Family and positivity is key in getting through any hurtle in life, Covid 19 is just another hurtle. </p><p></p><p></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Momma Must Have's]]></title><description><![CDATA[<hr><h2 id="-la-vie-lactation-massager-roller-stimulate-milk-flow">* La Vie: Lactation Massager Roller; Stimulate Milk Flow</h2><p>I would rate this product a 10 out of 10!

These are a few products I have tried and have come to find have been a big help in boosting my Booby Juice supply. </p><hr><h2 id="body-armor">Body Armor </h2><p>10 out of 10 for a yummy way to boost your Booby Juice Supply! Highly recommend getting the 28 oz bottles for only a $1.00 at Festival. I go through these so fast. They have a variety of flavors, Peach Mango is my personal fav! </p><p>They can be found on Amazon, at your local Pick N Save, Piggly Wiggly, Festival.</p><hr><h2 id="pink-stork-lactation-tea">Pink Stork Lactation Tea</h2><p>This product works great and for that I would rate it a 9 out of 10. If the taste was better I would say a 10 out of 10. I think it needs to be drunk before every pumping to really see good results. I have come to find that if I don't have it for every pump my milk supply isn't as good. You can drink this hot or cold, I highly recommend adding a slice or 2 of lemon. It only comes in 1 flavor Vanilla Chai, the taste is somewhat overpowering and has a strong black licorice undertone. Adding lemon really tones done the overpowering flavors. </p><p>This product was purchased on Amazon.</p><hr><h2 id="upspring-milk-flow-berry-flavored-breastfeeding-supplement-drink">UpSpring Milk Flow Berry Flavored Breastfeeding Supplement Drink</h2><p>I would rate this drink an 8 out of 10. The taste is not the greatest like my Body Armor but I love that I can add it to shakes and it comes in simple to go packs. This comes in a variety of flavors and can go in smoothies and water. </p><p>This product was purchased on Amazon.</p><hr><h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No Bake Lactation Bites]]></title><description><![CDATA[no-bake lactation cookies to boost milk supply]]></description><link>https://neighborlynook.com/lactation-cookies/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f205e4fab78810001ef3367</guid><category><![CDATA[recipe]]></category><category><![CDATA[breastfeeding]]></category><category><![CDATA[baby]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Samantha Zygowicz]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 17:51:20 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1578496005991-dd7038cd11bf?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=2000&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1578496005991-dd7038cd11bf?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&fm=jpg&crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&w=2000&fit=max&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ" alt="No Bake Lactation Bites"><p>As a first time mom I have found that these deliciously simple No Bake Bites are a life safer for your Milk Supply. </p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/2020/07/IMG_3727.png" class="kg-image" alt="No Bake Lactation Bites" srcset="https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/07/IMG_3727.png 600w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/07/IMG_3727.png 1000w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/07/IMG_3727.png 1600w, https://neighborlynook.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/07/IMG_3727.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Ingredients for No Bake Bites</figcaption></figure><h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2><ul><li>2 cups of old-fashioned oats</li><li>1/2 cup of flaxseed meal</li><li>3 tablespoons Brewer's yeast</li><li> 1 cup peanut butter</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li><li>1/2 cup honey</li><li> 1 teaspoon of vanilla</li><li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li></ul><p></p><h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2><p>Mix all ingredients except the chocolate chips together using a electric hand mixer until well combined. </p><p>Stir in the chocolate chips. </p><p>Roll mixture into 2-tablespoon sized balls and place on parchment-lined baking sheet. </p><p>Place in Refrigerator for 30 minutes or eat up right away.
